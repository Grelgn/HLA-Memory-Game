# Half Life: Alyx - Memory Game
#### Live Demo: https://grelgn-hla-memory.netlify.app/
#### Description:
This is a Memory Card Game, where your objective is avoid selecting the same card twice.
Select all 18 cards to win.

The game's theme revolves around Half Life: Alyx, a PC VR game developed by Valve.
More specifically, the theme incorporates the UI from the "Combine Fabricators" that are seen throughout the game.
The Combine Fabricators in-game model and animations have been adapted to my own game with care.
I have made some adjustments to the sequences of animations, sounds, and UI elements to make them more appropriate for my own project.
The card images are taken from combineoverwiki.net
I have manually made the images transparent using GIMP.
The blue filter on the images are made with a css filter.
The font used is Exo 2, which has the most resemblance to the font used by Valve.

This project uses React and JavaScript.

The assets owned by Valve Corporation are utilized in this project under fair use conditions.
